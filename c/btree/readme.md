Unlike linear data structures (Array, Linked List, Queues, Stacks, etc) which have only one logical way to traverse them, trees can be traversed in different ways. 

A Tree Data Structure can be traversed in following ways:

Depth First Search or DFS
-   Inorder Traversal => Traverse left, visit root, Traverse right  
-   Preorder Traversal => Visit root, traverse left, traverse right
-   Postorder Traversal => Traverse left, Traverse Right, Visit root
